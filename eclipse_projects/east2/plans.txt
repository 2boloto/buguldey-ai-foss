<egp_> i reanimate my old east project with modern available ontology engines. porting from opencyc 0.7.0b_win32
<egp_> east_project
<egp_> aka gandalf aka Autocoder
<egp_> not much there - some rigid nl parsing with ontologies, tree transformations, flexible engine
<egp_> would like to also insert code from my god_and_adam project as a toy behaviour source
