  They are already ok (default login uin, password, and contact list

- you may change src/org/jcq2k/icq2k/ICQ2KMessagingNetwork.properties.
  They are already ok (these are network, connection, protocol, and
  plugin tuning properties.)

- change the JDK_HOME variable in the run.bat 
  (jdk1.2+ should be ok.  Myself, I use jdk1.3.x AKA Java2 version 1.3.x.)

- run the run.bat

- enjoy.
