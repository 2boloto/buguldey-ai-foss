Q  I get error: "cannot find org.jcq2k.test.ICQMessagingTest.properties"
   I get error: "log4j system cannot initialize"

A  You should add the src/ directory to the classpath. It contains
   .properties files that should be available in the classpath


Q  Should I create several org.jcq2k.icq2k.ICQ2KMessagingNetwork instances?

A  No.  Create single instance, it will be shared between many user sessions.
   jcq is tested with 25 simultaneous users.
