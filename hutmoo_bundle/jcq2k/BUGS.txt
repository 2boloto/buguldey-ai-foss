
- does not receive all of incoming offline msgs at login
- interoperability with older icq clients (micq alike) is not checked
- sendmsg should use msgtype4 instead of msgtype2.  msgtype2 sometimes
  causes messages to be never delivered and/or causes a sendmsg timeout
  when waiting for an msgack.
- get user info sometimes fails.  needs to be updated according to
  massimo's spec.
