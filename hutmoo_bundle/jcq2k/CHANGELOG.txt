- The icq server changed its protocol (several days ago), it does no more
  send a MOTD packet (containing "http://www.aol.com") during login.
  This fatally breaks jcq functionality.  To workaround this,
  the line 1207 in src/org/jcq2k/icq2k/Session.java is commented out.

    //loginSequence_50waitForWwwAolComPacket(ctx);

  No other code changes.
- packaging cosmetic changes
- now, the buglist is a bit more long
- added small FAQ.txt
